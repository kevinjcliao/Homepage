# Homepage
Little StartTab page I've been working on.

There are currently some issues with this homepage.
1.  It is only confirmed to work on Firefox, no other browsers have been tested.
2.  Animations needed.
3.  Dynamic resizing of bookmark bar, bar items, and text needed.
4.  Code needs to be optimized.
5.  (Optional) A configuration menu should be added to allow users to more quickly and efficiently change the bookmarks and menu items
6.  (Optional) Allow changing of headers for page and dynamically space and create buttons depending on number of headers used.
7. Create a more appealing name...

Some files use the -moz-calc function, therefore I'm certain that there is no compatibility for these features on other browsers.
That will be worked on once the Homepage is fully functioning.
